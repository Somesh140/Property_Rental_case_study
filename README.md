Rent Estimation model

Company Background
Inn the Neighborhood is an online platform that allows people to rent out their properties for short stays. At the moment, only 2% of people who come to the site interested in renting out their homes start to use it.

The product manager would like to increase this. They want to develop an application to help people estimate how much they could earn renting out their living space. They hope that this would make people more likely to sign up.

Customer Question
The product manager would like to know:

Can you develop a way to predict how much someone could earn from renting their property that could power the application?
Success Criteria
They want to avoid estimating prices that are more than 25 dollars off of the actual price, as this may discourage people.
